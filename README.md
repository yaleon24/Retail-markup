# Retail-markup
Write a program that asks the user to enter an item's wholesale cost and its markup percentage.  If there is a markup of 100%, 100 will be entered into the program.  You will create a function calcRetail that takes in two doubles, the wholesale price and the markup.  The retail price will be returned from the function.  The program will continue to run until either a negative number is entered for the price or for the markup.  A negative number or negative markup will never be sent to the calcRetail function.  The prompts are as follows:      cout &lt;&lt; "Enter the wholesale price of the item:" &lt;&lt; endl;         cout &lt;&lt; "Enter the percent markup of the item:" &lt;&lt; endl;
